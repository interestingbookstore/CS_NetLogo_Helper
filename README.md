# What it is
The CS Netlogo Helper is a small python script I made, to make computer science homework easier. This project is really ironic now that I think about it.

# What it looks like
Like this, but a bit more saturated and less color managed

# What it does
Before anything happens, it gets the HTML from the homework website, and uses regular expressions to figure out what the latest assignment is (e.g. 54), and what the latest download is (in case he says "Download this NetLogo file"). This is pretty much instantaneous (given you have an internet connect of course, it straight up won't work if you don't (which will be fixed if I make a new version)). Anyway, now that it has the latest assignment and the latest download, it'll present you with three options:

- Download and add heading: The latest detected NetLogo file will be downloaded, the heading will be automatically applied to the top of the code, the file will then be saved wherever you specified in `options.txt`, and automatically opened with the default application.

- Generate and copy heading: A new heading will be generated, and copied to your clipboard. Note on headings: As with all of the options, the generated heading will be based off of what you specify in `options.txt`. "{latest_assignment_number}" will be replaced with the detected number of the latest assignment (e.g. 54).

- Generate file for homework: A blank NetLogo file will be generated by duplicating "template.nlogo", the heading will be automatically applied to the top of the code, the file will then be saved wherever you specified in `options.txt`, and automatically opened with the default application.

If you click on an option that generates a new file, the blank space at the top will be populated with the start time, as well as the time elapsed, formatted correctly (as shown above) :). To make things even simpler, you can copy the time elapsed to the clipboard by clicking on the clipboard icon.

# Extra
The clipboard icon used is from Google's icon collection, which can be found here, it's really cool!

The fonts used are Roboto-Medium and Roboto-Bold, which you can find here, it's a pretty good font.
